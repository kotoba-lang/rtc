  "Signaling protocol for WebRTC negotiation (SDP offer/answer, ICE
  candidates), transported over KNP ReliableOrdered channel. Restored
  from kami-rtc's `signal` module (deleted PR #82).

  `to-bytes`/`from-bytes` round-trip via EDN (`pr-str`/`read-string`)
  rather than JSON — a zero-dep portable equivalent to the original's
  `serde_json`, since payload is only ever consumed by other CLJC code
  in this migration, not a real JS/Rust wire peer."
